We often make plots in data science. 

Here's the tidyverse

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


Here's a dataframe.

```{r}
plot_df <-
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 2),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
  )
```

Here's a plot

```{r}
plot_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
