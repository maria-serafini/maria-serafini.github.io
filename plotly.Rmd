Interactivity is great. 

Here's the tidyverse

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

library(p8105.datasets)
```


Load the AirBnB dataset

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb") 

nyc_airbnb_df <-
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    rating = review_scores_location / 2
  ) |> 
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long
  ) |> 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan", 
    room_type == "Entire home/apt", 
    price <= 500,
    price >= 100
  )
```


Let's make a scatterplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb_df |> 
  mutate(
    label = str_c("Price: $", price) 
  ) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price,
    text = ~ label,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5
  )
```
